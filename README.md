# Plotly

The purpose of this project is to create a dynamic chart in Plotly in which volunteers can select their anonymized ID from a dropdown menu in the browser in order to display information about their belly button critters.

With the help of this dashboard, volunteers will be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species that live in their belly buttons. They will achieve this with the help of multiple data visualization charts: a horizontal bar chart, a bubble chart, and a gauge chart.
